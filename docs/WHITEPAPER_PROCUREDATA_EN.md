# PROCUREDATA: Data Orchestration for the Decentralized Economy

**Technical & Economic Whitepaper v1.0**

*Date: January 2026*  
*Ecosystem: Gaia-X / Pontus-X / IDSA*

---

## Abstract

ProcureData is the first Data Space infrastructure designed specifically for Procurement and Supply Chain functions. It eliminates operational redundancy in supplier validation through sovereign identities (DID) and smart data usage contracts (ODRL), transforming bureaucratic cost centers into liquid and secure data markets.

---

## 1. The Problem: The Redundancy Trap (n × m)

In today's economy, trust is manual, slow, and expensive.

### 1.1 Information Silos

The global supply chain operates in silos. A supplier (Data Subject) must send the same documentation (ISO certificates, tax data, ESG reports) to each of their clients (Data Consumers) individually.

### 1.2 The Cost of Verification

If 100 companies buy from the same 500 suppliers, **50,000 validation and maintenance processes** are performed redundantly. This generates:

- **Operational Friction**: Months to qualify a critical supplier.
- **Static Data Risk**: Information in the buyer's ERP expires the day after being validated.
- **Fraud and Greenwashing**: Lack of immutable traceability allows falsification of sustainability credentials.

---

## 2. The Solution: A Sovereign Data Space

ProcureData is not a "data lake" where everyone dumps their information. It's a system of **intelligent and secure pipelines** where data travels directly from Owner to Consumer, under strict rules.

### 2.1 The Trust Triangle (IDSA Model)

We adopt the reference architecture model of the International Data Spaces Association:

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **The Supplier (Data Provider/Subject)** | Maintains sovereignty. Data never leaves their control without a signed contract. |
| **The Buyer (Data Consumer)** | Accesses verified data in real-time for procurement, risk, or ESG processes. |
| **The Custodian (Data Holder)** | Neutral infrastructure (technical nodes) that facilitates exchange without "seeing" sensitive commercial content. |

### 2.2 Digital Supplier Passport

Instead of sending PDFs by email, each supplier in ProcureData has a **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)** based on DIDs (`did:ethr`). Their credentials (ISO, Solvency, ESG) are anchored to this identity, enabling instant and reusable verification:

> *"Verify once, use everywhere"*

## 4. Data Economy and Tokenomics

Unlike speculative projects, ProcureData uses an economy based on **real utility** and **financial stability**.

### 4.1 Stablecoin: EUROe

For commercial transactions (dataset purchases, validation service payments), we use **EUROe**, the first regulated electronic money (EMI) on blockchain compatible with MiCA.

| **No Volatility** | 1 EUROe always equals 1 EUR. |
| **Programmable** | Payments settle automatically (Smart Settlement) only when data is delivered and validated. |
| **Legal** | Billable and compatible with European corporate accounting. |

### 4.2 Asset Monetization

Suppliers can transform "data waste" into assets:

- **Compute-to-Data**: A supplier can allow an AI algorithm (e.g., risk prediction) to run on their private data without revealing raw data, charging for compute usage.
